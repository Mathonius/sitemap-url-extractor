# XML Sitemap Extractor - Project Planning Document

## 1. Requirements Gathering

### Problem Statement
The XML Sitemap Extractor is a web application designed to simplify the process of extracting URLs from XML sitemaps. Users can paste in a sitemap from any website, and the application will automatically extract all URLs, presenting them in an easily readable format.

### Target Users
- SEO professionals
- Web developers
- Digital marketers
- Website owners

### Key Features and Functionalities
1. Input field for pasting XML sitemap content
2. "Extract" button to initiate URL extraction
3. Output field displaying extracted URLs (one URL per line)
4. Counter showing the total number of extracted URLs
5. Simple, user-friendly interface

## 2. Conceptualization and Planning

### High-level Outline
1. Single-page web application
2. Two main sections: input and output
3. Processing happens client-side for faster performance

### MVP Scope
- Basic URL extraction functionality
- Simple, clean user interface
- Support for standard XML sitemap format

### Feature Prioritization
1. XML parsing and URL extraction (core functionality)
2. User interface design and implementation
3. URL count display
4. Input validation and error handling
5. (Future) Support for additional sitemap formats (e.g., RSS, Text)

| Total URLs extracted: X          |
+----------------------------------+
```

### User Flow
1. User visits the web application
2. User pastes XML sitemap into the input field
3. User clicks "Extract URLs" button
4. Application processes the input and extracts URLs
5. Extracted URLs are displayed in the output field
6. Total number of extracted URLs is shown

## 4. Architecture Planning

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- XML Parsing: Browser's built-in DOMParser API
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (for simplicity and free hosting)

### Data Flow
1. User input (XML string) → 
2. DOMParser (converts XML to DOM) → 
3. DOM traversal and URL extraction → 
4. Array of extracted URLs → 
5. Display in output field and update URL count

### API Endpoints
Not applicable for this client-side only application.

## 5. Development Plan

1. Set up project structure and version control (Git)
2. Create basic HTML structure
3. Implement XML parsing and URL extraction logic
4. Develop user interface with CSS
5. Add interactivity with JavaScript
6. Implement error handling and input validation
7. Optimize performance and user experience

## 6. Testing Strategy

- Unit Testing: Test XML parsing and URL extraction functions
- Integration Testing: Ensure proper interaction between UI and extraction logic
- User Acceptance Testing: Have target users test the application with various sitemaps

## 7. Deployment Plan

1. Set up GitHub repository
2. Configure GitHub Pages for hosting
3. Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions

## 8. Maintenance and Iteration

- Monitor GitHub Issues for user-reported bugs or feature requests
- Plan regular code reviews and refactoring sessions
- Consider adding support for additional sitemap formats in future updates
